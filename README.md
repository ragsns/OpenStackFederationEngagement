# OpenStack Federation Engagement

This is a repository to track engagement of EMC Federation with the OpenStack Meetups. The Mission is simple

* To position EMC Federation that it wants to engage with the community at the grassroots level
* To coordinate this engagement within the Federation
* Work with meetups to sponsor, provide speakers and other help as required

From a logistics perspective, it would be easiest to schedule the [Sessions] (TargetTopics), followed by [Panels] (TargetPanels) and finally [Hands-on Labs] (TargetHOLs).

We are targeting a few [Meetups](TargetMeetups) initially based on the membership levels and activity level.

Thanks are due to the following advisors

* Randy Bias, exceutive co-sponsor
* Shamail Tahir
* Sean Winn
* Andrew Shafer

We will plan on expanding this to the larger OpenStack community based on the initial success (or otherwise) of the program.

Please contact [us](mailto:raghavan.srinivas@emc.com) to make changes or to be added to modify the repository (I'll need your github handle).

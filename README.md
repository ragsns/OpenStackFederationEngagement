# OpenStack Federation Engagement

This is a repository to track engagement of EMC Federation with the OpenStack Meetups. The objectives are simple

* To position EMC Federation that it wants to engage with the community at the grassroots level
* To coordinate this engagement within the Federation
* Work with meetups to sponsor, provide speakers and other help as required

From a logistics perspective, it would be easiest to schedule the [Sessions] (TargetTopics), followed by [Panels] (TargetPanels) and finally [Hands-on Labs] (TargetHOLs).

We are targeting these [Meetups](TargetMeetups) initially based on the membership levels and activity level.

Please contact [us](mailto:raghavan.srinivas@emc.com) to be added to modify the repository.

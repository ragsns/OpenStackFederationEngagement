# OpenStack Federation Engagement

## Target talks

This is a partial list of the topics that might be interesting at meetups. There is a wide array of topics. Some of these sessions have been accepted at the OpenStack summit and some have not. 

Need 2-3 weeks heads up to coordinate speaker (especially if travel is involved) and content.

It's certainly possible to

* Tinker with some of the existing topics (changing titles, combining topics) or altering the level (101, 202, 303, etc.)
* New topics are possible but will require more heads up

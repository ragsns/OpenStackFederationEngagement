# OpenStack Federation Engagement

## Target panels

This is a partial list of the panels that might be interesting at meetups. We might test drive this at larger venues first based on panelist(s) availability.

We will need about 2-3 weeks heads up to coordinate panelists. Possibly more depending on the location and it's proximity from the Bay area or an OpenStack event location.

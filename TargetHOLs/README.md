# OpenStack Federation Engagement

## Target Hands-on Labs(HOLs)

Hands-On Labs are the hardest to pull off since they require good coordination and communication with the attendees. However, they are extremely satisfying when done well. 

We will need a minimum of 2-3 weeks to revise content, communication and coordination. It will be great if the local meetup can provide volunteers to help the attendees in case they're stuck.
